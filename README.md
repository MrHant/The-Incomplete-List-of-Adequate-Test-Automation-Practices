## Employee needs: Self-realization
One of the biggest problems of CIS countries: Each senior wants to play Tech Lead \ Architect role. A lot of seniors trying to do that on each new project. 

	Classic scenario:
		* Senior assigned on new project
		* Analyze code -> All is shit! I will change everything
		* He introduce design patterns / tools / automation approaches
		* Senior is happy, but feedback is negative

	Why is it happened? 

	All changes required a lot time for implementation. Senior trying to create "silver bullet". Adding new and new features. He is not understands why customer wanna something quickly. Our engineer cann't create "Architecture" fast. It is very important task for him. 

	At the same time customer wanna get value from automation. Senior ask for waiting from day to day. As a result customer has "Monster" automation framework which unsupprotable after a few monthes. Team should wait one more month for adding one more simple feature.

	As we can see: Two different pictures. Two different goal. Different expectations. 
	Customer unhappy because automation doesn't bring value. Engineer unhappu because of negative feedback.

	How to avoid this situation? How to find a "interesting" project?
	* Carefully read information about new position. Try to find opportunity.
	* Ask about  right questions during interview: Do we have framework? should we create from scratch it or improve existing one? Or I should create only new test and support olders? How ofter customer approved suggestions? etc.
	* Sync with customer his and your vision
	* Do not forget about his goals two. Try to clarify these goals from your first day.

	Before start new project go throught this "discovery phase". It helps you to find right project for self-realization without failed expectations.
